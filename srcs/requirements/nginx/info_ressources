# Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
## What is a CSR?
  - A certificate signing request (CSR) is an encoded file containing
    information about your website, service, organization, and domain
    name. This information is used by a certificate authority (CA) to
    create an SSL/TLS certificate for your website to encrypt traffic
    to your site. A certificate CSR also contains your public key and
    signature, which helps to verify identity and secure
    communications to your site.
